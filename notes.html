<!-- We need to start using a version control system.  Trying to remember what I completed last shift vs. what the codebase currently
contains is something that is easier/faster to understand with git/github.

- Proper method for documenting JavaScript code (only worry about short-form documentation, not long-form documentation) - read link below
	+ This documentation will help everyone understand the codebase and what has already been developed.
	+ No need to document html and css, that code is self-explanatory.

- We need to consolidate files and refactor code.
    + homepage.html and homepage.css are separate from results page.
    + Only should have one html, css, and javascript file for results page - shouldnt have multiple files for each language right now.
    + We need to refactor the code to make it more readable and understandable.
    + Need better documentation for javascript code.
